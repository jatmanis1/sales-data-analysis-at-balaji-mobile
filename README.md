# 📊 Optimizing Inventory and Pricing Strategies for Shree Balaji Mobile Care  
*A Data-Driven Approach for Operational Efficiency and Revenue Optimization*  

## 🧠 Project Overview  
This project was completed as part of the **BDM Capstone Project** under the **IIT Madras BS Degree Program**.  
It focuses on optimizing **inventory management** and **pricing strategies** for a small retail business — *Shree Balaji Mobile Care*, located in Bhilwara, Rajasthan.  

The store was facing:  
- **Dead stock accumulation** locking over ₹1.1 million in capital  
- **Unstructured pricing** due to informal bargaining, causing ~₹527,000 in annual revenue loss  

Through data analytics and business intelligence techniques, this project developed a **data-driven decision framework** to improve turnover, reduce waste, and increase profitability.
